### [__Twitter__](https://twitter.com) : The impact of restricting information input size.

&nbsp;

_The enemy of art is the absence of limitations._ — Orson Welles 


[_More broadly, research in several fields—spanning product design (Joyce 2009; Moreau and Dahl 2005), process management (Fritscher and Pigneur 2009), and education (Hen-nessey 1989)—suggests that having too much freedom can be paralyzing (epitomized by the feeling of staring at a blank sheet of paper), and that there is a sweet spot with just the right amount of constraints._](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/15079/14929)

When it comes to trading information, Twitter is one of the main places for public 'forum' like discussion that the public uses nowadays. Twitter has 396.5 million users, 38.5% of them being between the ages 25 - 34. One of the most interesting aspects, often the source of controversy inside the user base, is it's 280 character limit (prev. 140). It is widely believed by the public that this restriction imposes a block on complex discourse and encourages attention seeking by quick and provocative ideas. Whether this is the case or the effect of the limitation has not been scientifically proven. 

&nbsp;

Our main point of focus in this subject is how the complexity and, by relation, the length of the messages affect the overall structure of the discourse and the active traing of information. While the initial purpose of the app was to let people freely socialize, it has become an active battlefield for information by exposing people to a big amount of information in a short period of time and allowing them to freely build on it. The incentive is represented by tackling the human's need for social life and doing so it manages to grasp the attention and time of the user in a very productive manner. A certain type of addiction comes from the idea that the information presented to you could provide a benefit to your live, is crucial to the society as a whole, or the absence of it could result in social rejection. The result is a social hierarchy of opinions and widely believed information. This can be seen mostly in cancel culture and the idea that an opinion can be "wrong", thus proving the existence of a hierarchical structure. Because of the immense user and data size, Twitter allows for the creation of 'social bubbles' or groups that share commonalities. Because the app was not designed to filter for this, it does not do a good job of representing the group's core beliefs in a clear manner. Because the people using it are not aware of these aspects and are not actively reflecting on the issues, a lot of the conversations could be examples of "muddying the water to make it seem deep". Inside an information market, the same principles could be used to allow people to project their core beliefs and discuss them in a social manner, therefore solidifying Twitter as one of the main influences for our app.

&nbsp;

The influence of input size could be quickly summarized in two hypothesis:


[__H1__ _Imposing constraints has a positive effect on creativity, influencing users to create succinct content that is more likely to be appealing to others (Joyce 2009)._](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/15079/14929)


[__H2__ _Relaxing constraints provides users more space for ex-pressing opinion and allows for more potentially interesting content. Also, longer posts occupy a larger portion of the update feeds displayed to users (Rosen 2017), further increasing engagement._](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/15079/14929)

&nbsp;

While there is too much data to do a normal scientific study, some have attempted with smaller datasets. For example, this study tries to see changes in tweets made before and after the 2017 shift from a max. of 140 characters to 280. The results are not very well defined, but some changes are observed.
