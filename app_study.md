### [__Twitter__](https://twitter.com) : The impact of restricting information input size.

&nbsp;

_The enemy of art is the absence of limitations._ — Orson Welles 


[_More broadly, research in several fields—spanning product design (Joyce 2009; Moreau and Dahl 2005), process management (Fritscher and Pigneur 2009), and education (Hen-nessey 1989)—suggests that having too much freedom can be paralyzing (epitomized by the feeling of staring at a blank sheet of paper), and that there is a sweet spot with just the right amount of constraints._](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/15079/14929)

When it comes to trading information, Twitter is one of the main places for public 'forum' like discussion. One of the most interesting aspects, often the source of controversy, is it's 280 character limit (prev. 140). Some hold the belief that this restriction imposes a block on complex discourse and encourages attention seeking behaviour by extreme and provocative ideas. Whether this is the case or whether it is the effect of the character limitation has not been objectively proven. On the other side of the argument, the character constraint could potentially enhance communication by appealing to a creative method of phrasing. Twitter has been used [to inhance storytelling ability](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14790726.2015.1127975) before and some users on the platform have gained a following by having the ability to [_summarize an entire essay into a sentence_](https://twitter.com/naval).

Our main point of focus in this subject is how the complexity and, by relation, the length of the messages affect the overall structure of the discourse and the active trading of information. While the initial purpose of the app was to let people freely socialize, it has become an active information battlefield  by exposing people to a big amount of data in a short period of time and allowing them to freely build on it. The incentive is represented by tackling the human's need for social life, one of the most powerful evolutionary characteristic. A certain type of addiction comes from the idea that the information presented to you could provide a benefit to your live, is crucial to the society as a whole, or the absence of it could result in social rejection. It represents a social hierarchy of opinions and widely believed information. This can be seen mostly in _cancel culture_ like behaviours and the group belief that an opinion can be "wrong", or "not right enough" thus proving the existence of a hierarchical structure. Because of the big user base, Twitter allows for the creation of 'social bubbles' or groups that share commonalities. Because the app was not designed to filter for this, it does not do a good job of representing the group's core beliefs in a clear manner. Because the users do not necesarely have the goal of reaching truth, a lot of the conversations could be prime examples of people "muddying the water to make it seem deep". Inside an information market, the same principles could be used to allow people to project their core beliefs and discuss them in a social manner, therefore solidifying Twitter as one of the main influences for our app. Whether people need to be conscious of the implications of their opinion on a bigger scale in order to abstein from misinformation or socially appealing behaviour or you could de-bias for this is an open question.

&nbsp;

The influence of input size could be quickly summarized in two hypothesis:


[__H1__ _Imposing constraints has a positive effect on creativity, influencing users to create succinct content that is more likely to be appealing to others (Joyce 2009)._](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/15079/14929)


[__H2__ _Relaxing constraints provides users more space for ex-pressing opinion and allows for more potentially interesting content. Also, longer posts occupy a larger portion of the update feeds displayed to users (Rosen 2017), further increasing engagement._](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/15079/14929)

&nbsp;

While there is too much data to do a normal scientific study, some have attempted with smaller datasets. For example, [this study](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/15079/14929) tries to see changes in tweets made before and after the 2017 shift from a max. of 140 characters to 280. The results are not very well defined, but some changes are observed. Mainly, the difference can be seen in the probability that a user will use all the 140 characters. This denotes that users saw it as a clear restriction. In content, it is impossible for us at this stage to calculate how much information is in a single message and the study does not attempt to calculate the full entropy. One small but clear signal of increased entropy could be seen by the increase usage of filler words: _I am_, _and_, and the decreased number of abbreviations. These changes are small and therefore cannot help us reach a full conclusion.

Another similar study attempts to show how people change their writing style before and after the character change. [_pre-CLC tweets showed relatively more textisms, which are used to abbreviate and conserve character space. Consequently, they represent more informal language usage (e.g., internet slang); in turn, post-CLC tweets contained relatively more articles, conjunctions, and prepositions._](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0280-3). While the overall impact of slang is not clearly defined as good or bad, I would denote it as a way to reduce the entropy of a message and have a definite reduction of words while keeping the information content unchanged. _IMHO, this slaps._ A decrease in enthropy also means a decrease in the clarity. While it is clear that my last sentance has a positive outlook on the subject it is refering to, you as a reader have no idea why I believe that or just how much I agree with it. A more complex sentance structure (like the last sentance), while brimming with enthropy, has a very clear message. This is why most scientific papers sacrifice the enthropy limitation to aproache perfect clarity. 

One other important point is that people can chain tweets to create _threads_. This allows the user to input an unlimited number of words. It could be said that if a person wanted to express a bigger message, it would not be very different before or after the change to 280 characters. _Threads_ do come with their own disadvantages, mainly on the receptor's side, because they are not initially presented as chains but are promoted as one initial tweet, leaving the decision of showing the full thread to the user, thus minimising exposure and engagment. There is also no safeguarding when it comes to the order of the tweets by design, users have taken to noting down the number of the specific tweet in the chain, in the form _1/n_. 

Overall, while possible for people to brake the character limit, there is no incentive to do so unless desired. Single tweets are the ones that recieve the most promotion and exposure.
