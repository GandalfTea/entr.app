### [__Twitter__](https://twitter.com) : The impact of restricting information input size.

&nbsp;

_The enemy of art is the absence of limitations._ — Orson Welles 


[_More broadly, research in several fields—spanning product design (Joyce 2009; Moreau and Dahl 2005), process management (Fritscher and Pigneur 2009), and education (Hen-nessey 1989)—suggests that having too much freedom can be paralyzing (epitomized by the feeling of staring at a blank sheet of paper), and that there is a sweet spot with just the right amount of constraints._](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/15079/14929)

Twitter is one of the main places for public 'forum' like discussion. One of the most interesting aspects, often the source of controversy, is it's 280 character limit (prev. 140). Some hold the belief that this restriction imposes a block on complex discourse and encourages attention seeking behaviour by extreme and provocative ideas. Whether this is the case or whether it is the effect of the character limitation has not been objectively proven. On the other side of the argument, the character constraint could potentially enhance communication by appealing to a creative method of phrasing. Twitter has been used [to inhance storytelling ability](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14790726.2015.1127975) before and some users on the platform have gained a following by having the ability to [_summarize an entire essay into a sentence_](https://twitter.com/naval).

Our main point of focus in this subject is how the complexity and, by relation, the length of the messages affect the overall structure of the discourse and the active trading of information. While the initial purpose of the app was to let people freely socialize, it has become an active information battlefield  by exposing people to a big amount of data in a short period of time and allowing them to freely build on it. The incentive is obtained by tackling the human's need for social life, one of the most powerful evolutionary characteristic. A certain type of addiction comes from the idea that the information presented to you could provide a benefit to your live, is crucial to the society as a whole, or the absence of it could result in social rejection, often called FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). The app represents a social hierarchy of opinions and widely believed information. This can be seen mostly in _cancel culture_ like behaviours and the group belief that an opinion can be "wrong", or "not right enough" thus proving the existence of a hierarchical structure. Because of the big user base, Twitter allows for the creation of 'social bubbles' or groups that share commonalities. Because the app was not designed to filter for this, it does not do a good job of representing the group's core beliefs in a clear manner. Whether this is possible will be one of the main problems we have to deal with in creating an information market. Because the users do not necesarely have the goal of reaching truth, a lot of the conversations could be prime examples of people "muddying the water to make it seem deep", engaging in talks with the wrong incentives, do not research information and are plagued by biases. Whether people need to be conscious of the implications of their opinion on a bigger scale in order to abstein from misinformation, and whether this results in a socially appealing fallacy is is an open question. Inside an information market, the same principles could be used to allow people to project their core beliefs and discuss them in a social manner, therefore solidifying Twitter as one of the main influences for our app.

While a very interesting subject of analysis, Twitter and it's inpact have not been studied much because of it's scale. There are simply too many people on Twitter to have a controlled group and you cannot possibly understand where influences and ideas come from. For example, one interesting experiment would be to find out how much daily information comes from Twitter in the average user. How much their opinions can be swayed by the content there and how much "socially pleasing" content is preffered over truth. There are no studies covering this, as far as I am aware. This limits our analysis to a game of guessing.

&nbsp;

The influence of input size could be quickly summarized in two hypothesis:


[__H1__ _Imposing constraints has a positive effect on creativity, influencing users to create succinct content that is more likely to be appealing to others (Joyce 2009)._](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/15079/14929)


[__H2__ _Relaxing constraints provides users more space for ex-pressing opinion and allows for more potentially interesting content. Also, longer posts occupy a larger portion of the update feeds displayed to users (Rosen 2017), further increasing engagement._](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/15079/14929)

&nbsp;

While there is too much data to do a normal scientific study, some have attempted with smaller datasets. For example, [this study](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/15079/14929) tries to see changes in tweets made before and after the 2017 shift from a max. of 140 characters to 280. The results are not very well defined, but some changes are observed. Mainly, the difference can be seen in the probability that a user will use all the 140 characters. This denotes that users saw it as a clear restriction. In content, it is impossible for us at this stage to calculate how much information is in a single message. One small but clear signal of increased complexity could be seen by the increase usage of filler words: _I am_, _and_, and the decreased number of abbreviations. These changes are small and therefore cannot help us reach a full conclusion.

Another similar study attempts to show how people change their writing style before and after the character limit change. [_pre-CLC tweets showed relatively more textisms, which are used to abbreviate and conserve character space. Consequently, they represent more informal language usage (e.g., internet slang); in turn, post-CLC tweets contained relatively more articles, conjunctions, and prepositions._](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0280-3). While the overall impact of slang is not clearly defined as good or bad, I would denote it as a way to reduce the complexity of a message and have a definite reduction of words while keeping the information content unchanged. _IMHO, this slaps._ A decrease in complexity also means a decrease in the clarity of the message. While it is clear that my last sentance has a positive outlook on the subject it is refering to, you as a reader have no idea why I believe that or just how much I agree with it. A more complex sentance structure (like this sentance) has a very clear message.

One other important point is that people can chain tweets to create _threads_. This allows the user to input an unlimited number of words. It could be said that if a person wanted to express a bigger message, it would not be very different before or after the change to 280 characters. _Threads_ do come with their own disadvantages, mainly on the receptor's side, because they are not initially presented as chains but are promoted as one initial tweet, leaving the decision of showing the full thread to the user, thus minimising exposure and engagment. There is also no safeguarding when it comes to the order of the tweets by design, users have taken to noting down the number of the specific tweet in the chain, in the form _1/n_. 


#### Conclusion:
Twitter is more popular then other platforms when it comes to social discourse. The reasons for this are unclear. It could be the format or it could be a complete range of other reasons. What is known is that the format is not a clear limitation, otherwise people would not continue to use it. As for the use of these aspects in out app, we will try to implement a character limitation with the hopes of reducing complexity in some sections of the app, while not having a limitations in others to allow for clear messages. A mix could be created with the hopes of representing an idea inside of a potential 140 char. limit (low complexity, low clarity) to allow for variation of opinion and to stimulate a user to form their own view of the matter, and a potential blog-like entry open to each person to explain how they view the general statement, with a potential github-like tool for supporting, commiting or forking blogs (high complexity, high clarity)

### [__Clubhouse__](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/): Biasing information with human interaction


Since this plarform is very new, there are no studies on it. Everything that follows is my own opinion and experience with the app.

A lot of people see classic social as a sterile envirionment cut out from social norms. This results in users that abuse anonimity to behave erratically. Clubhouse tries to fix this by removing one aspect of that anonimity; you have to use your own voice to speak to other people. For many it feels like a live podcast or a bigger voice call where, depending on the room settings, there are a few active participants and the rest are listeners, or everyone can became a participant. Even if our app will most likely be centered around a visual method of presenting information, we are going to try to appreise wheather a "traditional" round table style online meeting is more preosperous then a basic online interaction.
